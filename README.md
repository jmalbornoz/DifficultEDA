# DifficultEDA
An example of a binary classification dataset that offers a difficult EDA

This notebook shows an example of a binary classification dataset that resulted refractory to the exploratory data analysis - in other words, the EDA did not show any features with predictive power; in spite of this, a predictive model was built with an AUC = 0.8566.

This is an example of a cleverly doctored dataset: all the features are numerical, and all of them contain apparent outliers.
